# Survivor Pool


## Rules
Create team(s) to pick one NFL team per week to win in their respective matchup. If they win, your team moves on to the next week. If they lose, your team is eliminated. You may only select an NFL team once throughout the season. The picks are not made against the spread and ties are counted as losses. Winner takes all.
